       We're on the lookout for values that contain the same last digit.
       You will be given two non-negative numbers to compare.
       Tip: Note that the % "mod" operator computes remainders, so 17 % 10 is 7.
       Return true if both digits have the same last digit.
       Example:
       compareLastDigit(7, 17) --> true
       compareLastDigit(6, 17) --> false
       compareLastDigit(3, 113) --> true

    The teacher decided to put a twist on the contest by providing one rule.
    Return the sum of two int values; but if the values are the same then return double their sum.

    Every string needs to begin with "not", in order to do that you need to add "not" to the beginning of a provided string.
    But if the string already begins with "not" we will leave it alone, no need to have a "not not".
    Return a new string where "not" has been added to the front.
    Tip: Use .equals() to compare 2 strings
    Example:
    beginWithNot("candy") --> "not candy"

       be less than 3, just need to provide whatever is there.
       Return a new string which is 3 copies of the front of the string.

    /* Problem 31
      Create the string to look like it's going up; like a hill. To do this we need to take the last 3 characters
      and make them uppercase. Even if there's less than 3 characters, just make whatever is there uppercase.
      Doing this allows the string to look like it's going up and down depending on if begins with uppercase or not.
      Tip: str.toUpperCase() returns the uppercase version of a string
      Return a new string where the last 3 characters are now in upper case.
      Example:
      goingUp("Hello") --> "HeLLO"
      goingUp("hi there") --> "hi thERE"
