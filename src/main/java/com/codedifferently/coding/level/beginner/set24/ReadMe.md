# Problem 24

You will be solving the given problem below.

## Problem

Every string needs to begin with "not", in order to do that you need to add "not" to the beginning of a provided string.
But if the string already begins with "not" we will leave it alone, no need to have a "not not".

Return a new string where "not" has been added to the front.

Tip: Use .equals() to compare 2 strings

Example:

beginWithNot("candy") --> "not candy"

beginWithNot("x") --> "not x"

beginWithNot("not bad") --> "not bad"
