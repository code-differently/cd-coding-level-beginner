    An elementary school teacher needs your help to create new strings for a fun activity they have planned.
     You will be provided a non-empty string and a number N. To create a new string, you will start with the character 0.
     Next you will add every Nth character of the string to the new string. Return the new string.

     Tip: If N is 3, use char 0, 3, 6 ... and so on. N is 1 or more.
