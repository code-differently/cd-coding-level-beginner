# Problem 30

You will be solving the given problem below.

## Problem

Again, we are looking for numbers that are within the range 10...20 inclusive.
But this time we are looking for the max value within that range out of the 2 positive int values.

Return the larger value that is in the range 10...20,
or return 0 if neither number is in that range.

Example:

larger1020(11, 19) --> 19

larger1020(19, 11) --> 19

larger1020(11, 9) --> 11
