      Create the string to look like it's going up; like a hill. To do this we need to take the last 3 characters
      and make them uppercase. Even if there's less than 3 characters, just make whatever is there uppercase.
      Doing this allows the string to look like it's going up and down depending on if begins with uppercase or not.

      Tip: str.toUpperCase() returns the uppercase version of a string

      Return a new string where the last 3 characters are now in upper case.

      goingUp("Hello") --> "HeLLO"
      goingUp("hi there") --> "hi thERE"
      goingUp("hi") --> "HI"
