## Problem

We're on the look-out for ounces "oz" within a string. You will be given a string,
and you need to determine if the first two characters yields "oz".
We need you to return a new string made of the first 2 chars (if present).

Only include first char if it is 'o' and only include second char if it is 'z'.

Example:

beginWithOz("ozymandias") --> "oz"

beginWithOz("bzoo") --> "z"

beginWithOz("oxx") --> "o"
