# Problem 09

You will be solving the given problem below.

## Problem
Provide two numbers, evalute both numbers to see which one is nearest to the value 10.
Some numbers may have the same range in how near they are to 10; such as 13 and 7 both are 3 from 10.
In that case, we would consider that event a tie.

Tip: Math.abs(n) returns the absolute value of a number

Return whichever number is nearest to 10, or return 0 for the event of a tie.

Example:

near10(8, 13) --> 8

near10(13, 8) --> 8

near10(13, 7) --> 0
